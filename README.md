# 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)


## Donations
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying me coffee, you can donate at my BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`. Thank you very much!
